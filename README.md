# Finder File Creator
This tool helps you create new files by clicking anywhere in the finder/desktop background. Is highly customizable and you can always create or modify the existing file templates to fit your need.
The host app it self dosent have an Editor-UI for file templates, it's done at the compile time.
The tool is also allows you to open the current directory in terminal, very basic functionality but unfortunately macOS doesn't support that.
