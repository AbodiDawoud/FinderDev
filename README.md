# Finder File Creator
This tool lets you create new files by simply clicking anywhere in the Finder or desktop background. It’s super customizable, and you can always create or modify the existing file templates to suit your needs.

The host app itself doesn’t have an Editor-UI for file templates. That’s done at compile time.

Additionally, the tool also lets you open the current directory in the terminal. It’s a basic functionality, but unfortunately, macOS doesn’t provide that.
